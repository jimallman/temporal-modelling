The original Temporal Modelling project was built in collaboration with 
Dr. Johanna Drucker and Dr. Bethany Nowviskie of SpecLab (the Speculative Computing
Lab) at the University of Virginia. Petra Michel, then a student at CalArts,
contributed some graphic design elements in the PlaySpace.

The work was sponsored by a generous grant from the Intel Corporation. For more
