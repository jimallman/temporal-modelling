The original Temporal Modelling project was built in collaboration with Dr.
Johanna Drucker and Bethany Nowviskie of SpecLab (the Speculative Computing
Lab) at the University of Virginia. Petra Michel, then a student at CalArts,
contributed some graphic design elements in the PlaySpace.

The work was sponsored by a generous grant from the Intel Corporation. For more
