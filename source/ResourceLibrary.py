# public resources (data models, etc)
#

# 'authInfo' is a dictionary in this format:

# This should always be optional, for normal HTML requests, but
# is available to support authentication from Flash XML-RPC (which
# doesn't support HTTP Basic Authentication)
#
# 'resourceID' is a string (NOT necessarily an int), a unique identifier
#
# 'resourceMetadata' is a dictionary in this format:
#     {'type':'story', 'name':'Tale of Two Cities', 'description':'It was the best...'}
#
# 'resourceData' is an XML string
