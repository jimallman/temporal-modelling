// Flash monitoring and debugging utilities// by Jim Allman (jim@ibang.com)// This script provides support for a persistent "monitor" window, mainly// as a diagnostic tool during development or trouble-shooting. Web pages// (or embedded critters like Flash movies) can report errors, status, etc// and they'll appear in a sort of "consold" window//// There should be a feature to enable/disable this reporting, perhaps a// query-string variable in the main web page. There should also be a way// for the user to "tune" the display, filtering by type of message or// importance (eg. "show me only the truly urgent stuff")//// This replaces a prior version using Javascript and an HTML form in the // child window. Unfortunately, the death of the LiveConnext technology // (on Mac and most newer browsers, as of 2002) doomed this solution. But// Flash MX comes to the rescue with its LocalConnection, which allows// any two Flash movies to communicate between windows or programs.//// Should this include a way for users/testers to upload the console's // output via email or CGI, for further analysis?/* TODO: Here's the priority filter logic; migrate this into the Flash monitor moviefunction report( stuffToReport, priority ){  // Post the reported message to our second "monitor" window, if it's available.
